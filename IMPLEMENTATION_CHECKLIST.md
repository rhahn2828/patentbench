> **Goal**: Ship the first reproducible, open benchmark for patent prosecution AI.
> **Timeline**: 12 weeks to v1.0 launch, 6 months to full scale.

## CODE TO ENABLE

Existing abigail-v3 code that maps directly to PatentBench needs:

| PatentBench Need | Existing Code | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| XML Office Action Parser | `backend/services/xml_office_action_parser.py` | Parses USPTO XML OA format into structured data. Production-tested on 10K+ OAs. |
| Evaluation Judges | `backend/services/evaluation/*.py` | LLM judge framework with rubric-based scoring. Needs calibration for benchmark use. |
| Benchmark API | `backend/orchestrator/routes/benchmark.py` | Route skeleton exists. Needs test-case runner endpoints. |
| USPTO Client | `backend/shared/clients/uspto_client.py` | PEDS API client for bulk OA download. Rate-limited, pagination implemented. |
| ROA Pipeline | `backend/services/openclaw/async_roa_drafter.py` | Response to Office Action drafting. Core prosecution evaluation target. |
| Expert Nodes | `backend/orchestrator/nodes/expert_*.py` | Domain-specific reasoning nodes (claims, prior art, prosecution). Reusable as evaluation subjects. |
| Document Parser | `backend/services/document_parser.py` | Multi-format document ingestion (PDF, DOCX, XML). Needed for test case input processing. |
| IDS Parser | `backend/services/ids_parser.py` | Information Disclosure Statement parser. Relevant for Admin domain test cases. |
